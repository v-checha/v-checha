## Hi, I'm Valerii

Backend developer. Architecture nerd. Based in Ukraine.

I've spent the last decade building Node.js applications and learning (often the hard way) what makes systems maintainable at scale. These days I focus on database architecture, API design, and helping teams avoid the mistakes I've already made.

**What I work with:** TypeScript · JavaScript · Node.js · Databases · AWS · GCP
